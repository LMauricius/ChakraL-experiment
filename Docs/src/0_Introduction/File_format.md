# File format

Here are described the file formats, folder structures and conventions used in ChakraL.

## File naming

The file names must start with a letter and can contain leters, digits and underscores. Double underscores are forbidden. If the file has multiple extensions (separated by multiple dots), all but the last extension will be ignored.

## File extensions

### Source file
The extension for the source files should be `ckr`
